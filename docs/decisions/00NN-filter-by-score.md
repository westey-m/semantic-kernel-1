# Support Filtering by Score in Vector Search in the Vector Store Abstractions

## Context and Problem Statement

Langchain uses score_threshold for naming, see [here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant.html#langchain_community.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant.asimilarity_search_by_vector).
However, it doesn't support the parameter consistently, e.g. it's simply missing for [pinecone](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_pinecone.vectorstores.PineconeVectorStore.html#langchain_pinecone.vectorstores.PineconeVectorStore.asimilarity_search_by_vector), which I don't believe support this feature.
